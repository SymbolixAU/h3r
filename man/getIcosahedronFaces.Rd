getIcosahedronFaces(cell)
}

\item{cell}{vector of H3 cells}
}

Faces are represented as integers from 0-19, inclusive.
The array is sparse, and empty (no intersection) array values are
represented by -1.
}
\examples{
getIcosahedronFaces(cell = c("8cbe63562a54bff","8cbe635631103ff"))

getIcosahedronFaces(cell = cellToParent(c("8cbe63562a54bff" ,"8cbe635631103ff"), c(7L, 7L)))
